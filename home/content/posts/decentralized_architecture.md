Fragmentation is not only a common pitfall for networks but also any decentralized architecture (DArch) such as poly repositories, micro services, [modular operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) etc..

These are all computing examples but insert it with anything that involves a final useable system such as a bike with standardized wheels or a house with standardized doors.

Fragmentation makes it extremely hard to build a final useable system because now the end user has to select from a wide array of options and we all know now about [the paradox of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6XEQIsCoM).

I believe this is a common pitfall for any decentralized network and probably the most commonly used argument I have heard for centralization.

So what can we learn from other successful DArches?

  1.  In every use case involving a successful DArch, there will be a need for 'scaffolds' and 'scaffolding tools'.

There are a ton of [examples](/javascript_scaffolding_tools) of this in JavaScript because JavaScript developers love DArches.

But there are other examples of scaffolds in other DArches such as Ubuntu (or pick your flavour of Linux) for operating systems or scaffolding tools such as Docker / Kubernetes for cloud environments.

Scaffolding tools enable quick assembly of something 'good enough' and scaffolds are the 'good enough' solution that designers share with others.

If the scaffold is designed properly (ie/ it is cohesive) then we have an elegant solution that works out of the box and is easily configurable when the out of box experience stops suiting our needs.

They enable DArches to flourish in a few ways.

The tool enables anyone to create their own final usable system and share it with others such that others only need to trust that the assembler knows what they are doing.

The scaffold enables anyone to switch out one of the components easily.

In other words they reduce the chances of entrenchment of a single house maker and/or door maker.
