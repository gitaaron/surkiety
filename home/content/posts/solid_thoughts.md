Another question I have is who owns the data in a social context?

Eg/ if I make a post on a [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) the owner of the BBS should probably have delete permissions on my post but I should have edit.

I guess I am just scratching the surface and need to [dig further](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(animal)#/media/File:ScalopusAquaticus.jpg).
