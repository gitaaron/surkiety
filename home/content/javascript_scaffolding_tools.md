A non comprehensive list.  Each one of these 'scaffolding tools' may serve a different audience/purpose.

They are about enabling people to package up a recipe of ingredients and share them with others.

Others could be their users, other developers within an organization, other developers around the world, or even non human entities such as an automated testing system.

Without them we would be stuck with a single monolithic language because otherwise it would be impossible for groups to get anything done.
